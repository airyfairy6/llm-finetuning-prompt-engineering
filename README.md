LLM Prompt Engineering & Fine-Tuning Project

This repository showcases hands-on experience with LLM prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and toxicity reduction, developed through three practical labs:

Dialogue Summarization Using Prompt Engineering

Fine-Tuning a Generative AI Model on Custom Data

Detoxifying Model Outputs Through Supervised Fine-Tuning

Together, the labs demonstrate real-world skills used in Model Development, Applied NLP, and LLM Engineering roles, including prompt optimization, dataset preparation, fine-tuning workflows, and evaluation techniques.
